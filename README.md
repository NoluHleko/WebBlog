## About This Application
This application is a take on modern blogs. The [Soledad](https://soledad.pencidesign.net/soledad-simple/?demo=standard&sidebar=right) theme grid layout inspired it. Although initially meant as a personal blog, multiple users can use it. Additionally, It is completely responsive with the desktop-first approach.

The blog has four pages and a dashboard for administrative purposes. Users can register, log in, and log out, and their information is authenticated.


## Features

- [Contact Me](http://nolusindiso.herokuapp.com/contactme) linked to the blogger's Gmail account via the [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) messaging API.
